# Daily Update - Session Management Improvements

## Completed Tasks

1. **Enhanced Session Expiration Handling**: Implemented a comprehensive solution for session expiration that prevents page refreshes and provides a user-friendly experience. Created a SessionExpiredModal component that shows a countdown before automatic logout, giving users time to save their work.

2. **Robust Token Refresh Mechanism**: Completely revamped the token refresh system with multiple layers of protection including mutex-based synchronization, multiple token sources, proper token storage, and automatic token cleanup. This prevents the "Invalid Refresh Token: Already Used" error that was causing page refreshes.

3. **Platform Isolation Implementation**: Fixed critical issues with platform isolation where WhatsApp API requests were being made even when WhatsApp wasn't connected. Updated contactService.js, contactSlice.js, and Dashboard.jsx to properly check platform connection status before making API requests.

4. **Extended Session Duration**: Increased session duration to 5 hours to provide users with a longer uninterrupted experience. This reduces the frequency of authentication-related interruptions while maintaining security.

5. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling throughout the application to provide better user feedback and prevent jarring experiences. Replaced toast notifications with modal dialogs for critical authentication errors.

## Technical Details

- Modified `tokenManager.js` to implement a sophisticated token refresh mechanism with fallbacks and proper error handling
- Created `SessionExpiredModal.jsx` to provide a user-friendly interface for session expiration
- Updated `api.js` to use custom events instead of direct page refreshes for authentication errors
- Enhanced `contactService.js` and `contactSlice.js` to check platform connection status before making API requests
- Modified `Dashboard.jsx` to conditionally render platform-specific components based on connection status
- Updated `App.jsx` to listen for session expiration events and show the SessionExpiredModal

## Next Steps

- Implement comprehensive testing for the new authentication system
- Add additional platform-specific error handling for WhatsApp and Telegram
- Enhance the session recovery mechanism to further reduce authentication interruptions
- Improve the visual design of the SessionExpiredModal to match the application's theme
