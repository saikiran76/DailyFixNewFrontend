# Critical Fixes for DailyFix Application

## Issue: Application Constantly Reloading and Authentication Problems

### Root Causes Identified:
1. Multiple sliding sync instances fighting with each other
2. Token expiration issues causing 401/403 errors
3. Infinite loops in Matrix client initialization
4. Page reload loops triggered by window.location.reload() code

### Fixes Implemented:

#### 1. Fixed SlidingSyncManager
- Replaced global sync flag with timestamp-based approach to prevent multiple sync loops
- Added token validity check before performing sync
- Improved error handling and recovery for Matrix client in ERROR or STOPPED states
- Added proper delays between retries to prevent rapid retries
- Implemented proper cleanup of resources

#### 2. Fixed TelegramContactList
- Removed window.location.reload() call after joining Telegram room
- Implemented proper UI update mechanism instead of page reload
- Added direct room access to show contacts immediately

#### 3. Fixed MatrixInitializer
- Improved token monitoring to check validity much sooner
- Added immediate token check to catch existing token issues
- Reduced token check interval from 30 minutes to 5 minutes

#### 4. Fixed SessionExpirationHandler
- Added rate limiting for Matrix re-authentication attempts
- Improved error handling for Matrix 401/403 errors
- Added timestamp tracking to prevent excessive re-authentication

#### 5. Fixed Dashboard Component
- Added localStorage persistence for selected platform
- Improved platform switching logic
- Added loop detection to prevent infinite initialization loops
- Fixed account management to properly handle Telegram and WhatsApp accounts

#### 6. Fixed AppRoutes Component
- Replaced console.log with logger.info for better debugging
- Improved redirect logic to prevent unnecessary page reloads

### Benefits:
1. Eliminated constant page reloads
2. Improved authentication stability
3. Better error handling and recovery
4. Smoother user experience
5. Reduced server load from excessive API calls
6. Proper session management

### Additional Recommendations:
1. Implement comprehensive error boundary components
2. Add more detailed logging for authentication flows
3. Consider implementing a service worker for offline support
4. Add automated tests for authentication and session management
5. Implement a more robust token refresh mechanism
